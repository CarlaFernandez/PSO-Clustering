# PSO-Clustering
## Core: To-Do
#### Important
* Check how to represent a particle's position
* Find a way to represent particles' positions for a human-readable program

#### Not-so-important
* Different stopping conditions
* Support for local search
* Optimize to provide support for more files (SVD?)

## Extensions
* Performance comparison with different parameters
* Implement different algorithms (ACO, K-Means...)
* Supervised classification
